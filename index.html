            This interactive narrative visualization explores how COVID-19 unfolded across Illinois counties by combining temporal, spatial, and statistical perspectives.
          </p>
          <p>            
            The visual story investigates disparities in case spread, mortality, and impact across different regions and population types urban, suburban, and rural.
          </p>
          <p>             
            The goal is to reveal how <strong>COVID-19’s severity, pace, and geographic footprint varied and what these patterns tell us about vulnerability, response, and population structure across the state.</strong>
          </p>

        <h2>The Dataset</h2>
        <div class="intro">
          <p>
            This dataset from the New York Times chronicles daily COVID-19 cases and deaths across all 103 counties in Illinois,
            spanning from January 24, 2020 to May 13, 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each row represents the cumulative case and death count for a county on a specific day. The dataset enables
            exploration of trends over time, regional disparities, and key surge events.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary research question: <strong>How did COVID-19's spread, severity, and impact differ over time and space across Illinois counties and what correlations emerge between population type, case volume, and mortality trends?</strong>

          <p>
            <strong>Messaging : </strong>
            While COVID-19 affected all of Illinois, its impact varied significantly by county shaped by regional density, healthcare infrastructure, and population vulnerability. 
            This visualization unpacks how these differences emerged across time, geography, and severity.
          </p>          
          <p>
            <strong>Narrative Structure : </strong>
            This narrative visualization follows a Martini Glass structure, a storytelling format that begins with a linear, guided narrative and transitions into a space for user-driven exploration.
          </p>   
          <p>
            <strong>1. Introductory scenes </strong>
            provide important context about the dataset and the motivation behind the analysis.
          </p>    
          <p>
            <strong>2. The narrative then unfolds through a fixed sequence of scenes</strong>
             each presenting a different perspective (time evolution, spatial comparison, correlation, ranked impact).
          </p>   
          <p>
            <strong>3. Toward the end</strong>
             more interactive charts (like the log/linear scatter plot and choropleth map with dropdown filter) enable exploratory analysis.
          </p>  
          <p>

            Each scene focuses on a different analytical dimension time, space, correlation, ranking culminating in a multifaceted story.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Interactive Time Slider(Bubble Timeline Chart) : </strong>
            Chart 1 dynamic bubble chart allows users to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic evolved across Illinois counties over time. 
            The chart encourages temporal exploration and regional comparisons.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>County-Level Mapping with Dropdown Filter(Choropleth Map) : </strong>
            Charts 2 choropleth map displays the spatial distribution of cumulative COVID-19 cases across all Illinois counties.
            A dropdown menu at the top allows filtering and highlighting a specific county.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Correlation Analysis Using Log Scale(Scatter Plot) : </strong>
            Charts 3 scatter plot investigates the relationship between total COVID-19 cases and deaths per county. 
            The log-scale transformation enhances visibility of smaller counties while preserving proportionality.
            Dropdown enables isolating a single county for contextual focus. Switch button toggles log/linear modes
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Direct Volume Comparison with Linear Scale(Scatter Plot) : </strong>
            Charts 3 scatter plot with linear scale to reveal actual case and death totals. 
            Ideal for emphasizing raw volume differences rather than proportional relationships. 
            Switch button toggles log/linear modes
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ranked Comparison Across Counties(Bar Chart) : </strong>

        <div class="intro">          
          <p>
            <strong>Scene 1 (Bubble Timeline):  </strong>
            Temporal annotations indicate key surge dates (e.g., Nov 2020), supported by timeline progression. Bubble size changes act as implicit annotations showing growth trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scene 2 (Choropleth Map):  </strong>
            Hoverable tooltips provide case counts per county. The county dropdown acts as a pseudo-annotation by visually emphasizing the selected region.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scene 3 & 4 (Scatter Plot): </strong>
            Annotations appear through interaction. Dropdown filtering isolates a county and adjusts axes to spotlight its outlier or typical behavior. 
            The log/linear toggle is an implicit annotation that changes interpretive context.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scene 5 (Bar Chart): </strong>
            Direct labeling of top counties (e.g., Cook, DuPage) reinforces their ranking without needing interactivity. 
            Bars are color-coded to subtly cue demographic type (urban, rural).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Dynamic vs Static Annotations </strong>
            Static annotations used in bar chart and choropleth map to provide consistent reading without requiring interaction.
            Dynamic annotations used in scatter plots and bubble timeline where tooltips and dropdown-triggered zooming function as interactive annotations.
